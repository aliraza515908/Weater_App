# Weather_App
🌤️ Python Weather App (API-Based)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Python-based Weather Application that fetches real-time weather data for any city using a public weather API. The application runs in the terminal and allows users to check current weather conditions in a simple, interactive way.

The goal of this project is to practice real-world Python development by working with external APIs, handling JSON data, and implementing proper error handling.

🚀 Features

Fetches real-time weather data for any city worldwide
Displays:
Temperature (°C)
Weather condition
Humidity
Wind speed
User-friendly command-line interface
Handles invalid city names gracefully
Clean, modular, and readable Python code

🧠 Concepts & Skills Practiced

API integration using the requests library

JSON data parsing

Functions and modular programming

Exception handling and input validation

Working with real-world external services

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3
WeatherAPI
requests library

▶️ How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app-python.git

Install dependencies:
pip install requests

Run the program:
python weather_app.py

Enter a city name (e.g., Karachi, London) to view the weather.

📈 Why This Project Matters

Instead of relying only on certificates, this project demonstrates practical Python skills by interacting with live data from an external API. It reflects my focus on building strong programming fundamentals before progressing to Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects.
